Justifications:

-
Did not completely move printing to view.cpp for stricter MVC rules, I would prefer to use View.cpp for the printing function by sending strings to it for printing. The reason for this is because I do not want to create dependencies by sending the Model's structured data response into View. In the event the business logic changes, View would also be required to adapt to the new structured data output from Model. Having them decoupled would mean I am able to easily change the View and Model without dependencies getting in the way.

-
In View.cpp, theres a View::askMonth() and View::askYear(). In theory, I could combine them and have a single function for asking inputs. However, the responsibility of the input validation would then fall back on the AppController after a response have been returned, this leads to the AppController having to request for a new input if the validation fails. IF theres a growing amount of features that requires asking the user for inputs, I might refactor this part to have a more flexible function to handle all types of inputs. But at this point when theres only 2, I prefer the View to handle the input validation directly as there is lesser overhead.

The relationship between AppController and Model is such that weather_data will always be sent as a parameter each time a menu option has been selected. It is possible to send a weather_data pointer into Model during instantiation (either as part of constructor overload or setter) to reduce parameter bloat. However, this would cause a tighter coupling between Model and WeatherData even though its only through a pointer. I would prefer to keep the application stateless and allow Model to handle a variety of data structures with a single parameter, instead of having to instantiate/setter with each data structure(BST/Vector) this application uses. This allows better scalability.

During Loading of the data, Bst will currently ignore any duplicated rows that have similar Date & Time and only the earliest row will be inserted. I am choosing to do this because its the most convenient way to address duplicated records. It is POSSIBLE to write a logic to perhaps average the data and I am well aware of other methods, however as there isn't an explicit way mentioned to handle this, I have chosen to use the most convenient method.
